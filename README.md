<h1>InstaQuack!</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>InstaQuack! is a mock social media service that provides users a way to communicate what they are doing using real time photos with short captions. The project uses the publish/subscribe model (Fig 1) to allow data (photos) sharing between content creators (publishers) and subscribers. Publishers send their data to a broker which stores it under a given (specified by publisher) topic. Subscribers can then receive the data from the broker for the topics they are subscribed to.</p>

<p>The Quacker Topic Store i​s where recently published photos are stored. The Quacker server serves as an intermediary for publishers and subscribers to store/receive photos. The server creates threads to perform work for publishers and subscribers. The interface facilitating client-server interaction is the series of command files for a given publisher or subscriber (client). The server gives these files to its appropriate threads (publisher or subscriber) and they interpret the files and perform the commands. Before this can happen, the server also has to be initialized using a main command file (which is interpreted and the initialization commands are performed). Finally, once the server has been initialized and the publisher/subscriber threads have been created, subscriber threads use the gathered data to create the ​InstaQuack Topic Web Pages (dynamic html pages). This allows a client to open each of the files and see what each subscriber was able to get from the topics.</p>

  	<li>To run: ./server input.txt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Publisher and Subscriber Tests</h2>
<ul>
	<li>input_full_publisher_test.txt - successfully pushes all topic entries without dequeuing.</li>
	<li>pub_dont_give_up_.txt - Successfully continues to push all topic entries before dequeing after 30 seconds (delta = 30)</li>
	<li>sub_empty_test.txt - Unsuccessfully attempts to get topic entries from an empty queue. Program exits normally.</li>
	<li>normal_test (directory) - Screenshots from given project input.</li>
</ul>
